<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Product Name: playlistDB</li>
    <li>Team Members: Marcel</li>
    <li>Application Overview (overview from a end user perspective): This Database will be a collection of songs  that are shuffled into various playlists. They should have track length, artist name, song title, a link to the lyrics, and perhaps a link to a music video on youtube.</li>
    <li>Technology Overview (languages, libraries, platforms, hosting): The database will be written in Mysql using XXAMP shell.  Iâ€™m not sure how ill display it graphically so I will have to discuss that further with professor pogue. I will deploy it on github and host it on microsoft azure for now.</li>
    <li>Proposal Last Updated (the date the proposal was last updated) This is the first draft.</li>
    <li>Feature List</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Tables for different playlists, the entire collection, and artist information.</li>
        <li>Fields for track length, artist name, song title, and links to lyrics/music videos</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Future Feature List (non-prioritized list of end user features that would be implemented if there was more time)</li>

    <ul>
        <li>A search function to look for different songs in the table that has all the songs and  is displayed on the screen</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Basic Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that demonstrates things you have learned in the class)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Create or manipulate an already different mysql database of music (If I find another db someone made my goal would be to use the structure but put music from my own playlists in it instead)
        </li>
        <li>Display this database graphically somehow using presumably Javascript HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>Host it on Github</li>
        <li>Deploy it on microsoft azure</li>
        <li>basic GUI on the screen</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Advanced Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that go beyond what we learned in class)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Possibly host it using AWS instead of microsoft azure</li>
        <li>Advanced GUI</li>
        <li>Ability to play the songs</li>
       </ul>
</ol>
